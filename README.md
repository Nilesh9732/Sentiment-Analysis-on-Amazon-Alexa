## Objective 
The primary objective of this project was to leverage NLP(Natural Language Processing) techniques to analyze Amazon Alexa reviews, aiming to predict and classify fresh or new customer feedback. By accurately identifying sentiment trends and patterns, the project sought to provide valuable insights for enhancing product development, improving customer satisfaction, and informing strategic decision-making processes.
## Roadmap
- Gathered Amazon Alexa review data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed data distribution, trends, and patterns to inform feature engineering.
- Cleaned and prepared data using tokenization, lemmatization, and stop words removal.
- Extracted and scaled relevant features to enhance model performance.
- Chose Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree algorithms for sentiment analysis.
- Trained models and fine-tuned hyperparameters using XGBoost.
- Assessed model accuracy and performance on validation data.
- Implemented the best-performing model to predict and classify fresh feedback.
